## Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


## 1. Loading and preprocessing the data
##    
### read set
```{readset, echo =TRUE}
actmon <- read.csv("activity.csv", sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE, na.strings = "NA")
```
### get data frame information 
```{r dfinfo, echo = TRUE, result="hide"}
summary(actmon)
str(actmon)
```
## 2. What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r stepsmean, echo = TRUE}
mean(actmon$steps, na.rm = TRUE)

```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
